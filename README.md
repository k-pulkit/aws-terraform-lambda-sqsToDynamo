## Project Name: Terraform AWS Infrastructure Automation
> SQS to DynamoDb with lambda

## Description
This is a terraform project, built to practice as well as showcase my terraform skills. In this project I have build a basic pipeline to stream messages coming from SQS queue into a dynamodb table. The architecture is event driven with the help of lambda severless processing.

The soul of the project is the `terraform-aws-infra` directory, and constitutes __70 percent__ effort of the project. 

## Terraform has been used to create the following resource
* DynamoDb tables
* SQS Queue
* IAM Policies and Roles
* Lambda Function
* Lambda Function trigger as SQS

## Prerequisites
Before diving in, make sure you have the following tools installed:
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) (v0.14+)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) (v2+)

## Architecture Diagram
